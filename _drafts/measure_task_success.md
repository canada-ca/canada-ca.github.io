Task success is a critical measurement for Canada.ca. Over the years, success rates for most top tasks have been measured in moderated task-based scenario research studies with Canadians.  As we conducted these studies across the vast scope of Canada.ca, we realized that we needed a new way to break down task success metrics to make the results actionable for the right teams.  Theme Leads are focused on the navigation layer while specialists tend to work on the actual content. To help assess the success of the navigation layers and Search, we broke out Findability from the Task Completion Rate. 

Findability success rate = the percent of participants who visited the target page(s) for the task, either via search or navigation.
* Findability example: For the task of finding out whether your symptoms are more likely to be the flu versus a cold, the target page selected by the team is the [Flu Symptoms page](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/symptoms-flu-influenza.html). 
** 100% of 16 participants found the Flu Symptoms page 
Task completion rate = the percent of participants who correctly answered the task without guessing, either from the task content on the target page or on another page. 
* Task completion example: The flu symptoms target page showed a list of flu and cold symptoms. Participants had to select both headache and fever from a list of symptoms as the most important signals that they had the flu rather than a cold. 
** Only 50% of participants correctly selected both headache and fever as the flu symptoms that signal they have a flu versus a cold. This situation of a High findability rate and low completion rate is a 'Content gap'. Clearly, it's the flu symptoms specialists who must take action to improve the task completion rate.  

Findability | Completion | Example
--- | --- | ---
Success | Success |  Used target Flu Symptoms page to answer correctly
Success | Failure |  Found Flu symptoms page but didn't select Fever and Headache 
Failure | Success |  Searched and found a PDF of a 2010 Influenza poster in GC publications, answered correctly
Failure | Failure |  Didn't find the Flu symptoms page, didn't select the correct symptoms

Coding Success and Findability separately gives more latitude to be accurate and consistent in our coding, especially when people search to find the answers. Findability requires that the team declare target pages prior to the testing for a particular task scenario. The path and the target pages are usually the ones designed to hold the answer to the task, although in some cases, the design may not have been well-thought-out prior to testing. In a sense, the team is stating and pre-registering their hypothesis about the path to successfully completing the task.

* In our Flu symptoms example, the team selected the Symptoms page as the target because it is designed to show the answer. No one was even aware of the existence of the 2010 Influenza poster that showed up in the search results. 

Coding task completion is somewhat simpler once findability is broken out. We start with participants who answered correctly. If the person was using the target page, usually the only way to get the correct answer is by successfully using a tool, or opening a tab or reading the answer, so they are clearly successful.

* On the flu symptoms page, half the people who got to the target page answered incorrectly - they skimmed too quickly and/or didn't understand that they had to mentally remove the cold symptoms from the flu list to correctly identify the 'flu only' symptoms. 

On non-target pages though, the coding requires a little more work. Usually we review the video to see if the page they had reached does directly answer the task, in which case they are coded as successful. More often, the page they found didn't address the answer in enough detail to correctly derive the answer, and people took a lucky guess at the correct answer, which we code as a task completetion failure.
