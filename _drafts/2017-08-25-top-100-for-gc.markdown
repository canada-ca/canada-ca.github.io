<!-- Goals

* help understand why we're collecting top tasks
** How does it make things better for people?
* what exactly are tasks? how are they different from services? what about the sub-tasks and offline tasks that are important?
* how do we manage canada.ca performance by what the user is trying to do?

-->

People come to Canada.ca with a goal in mind and a task that they want to accomplish. And Canada.ca is about delivering services and information from right across the Government of Canada. Top tasks are the most important and most used tasks. By managing the top tasks, we can effectively meet the needs of most people.

There are a huge number of tasks to support on Canada.ca. We focus on the [top 100 tasks list for the Government of Canada](https://canada-ca.github.io/pages/top-task-list-canada-ca.html).

## Top tasks form the basis for Canada.ca

Top task management isn't new to the Government of Canada. In 2013, we compiled the first government-wide top task list to help design Canada.ca. And even earlier, several departments were experimenting with top task management for their own sites.

Since then, we've gone through 3 major iterations of the top task list. Each time we do it, we improve how we gather comparable data and tasks.

## How we compiled the list

A 3-phase approach is used to create the top task list for Canada.ca:

### 1. Collecting the top task data

The first step is to collect the top task data. We start with institutions which have the most popular content on Canada.ca. Some of the sources include:

* web analytics 
* Departmental plans
* Mandate letters (from the Prime Minister to cabinet ministers)
* feedback or call centre reports
* input from people who manage programs
* Input from the staff working with the public
* past research or surveys

#### Challenges when collecting data from different sources

There are some challenges in trying to collect data from so many different sources, such as: 

* <b>Analytics comparability:</b> 
**many web analytics tools are in use, some more effective than others
**some free analytics software only samples data across visits instead of recording everything
**some track effectively, but are very inefficient at generating reports
* <b>Visits versus pageviews:</b> 
**visits represent a real person completing a task better than pageviews
**pageview numbers can inflate when a task involves multiple pages
* <b>Start pages versus all pages:</b> 
**some tasks require several different pages, while others only one page 
**combined traffic for many pages reduces comparability
**it's therefore important to identify and track one start page per task	

### 2. Analyzing and ranking the tasks

The second phase involves comparing tasks from widely different departments and agencies. At the government-wide level, we separate core tasks from their supporting sub-tasks.

For instance, "Get a passport" is a popular task. But to actually accomplish the goal of getting a passport, you'll have to do a number of steps. We call these smaller steps "sub-tasks" like:

* see if you're eligible to get a passport
* check passport photo requirements
* download the passport request form

If you were a content designer working on passports at a department or agency, then you’d need to keep track of all of these sub-tasks. But for our purposes, “Get a passport” provided enough detail to help us manage the task at the government-wide level.

We could have named the task "Canadian passports", but we wanted to keep the tasks as answers to the question, "why are people coming to the site?" We write each task as a verb to make clearer what people are trying to do.

Once the core tasks are identified, we rank them based on visits to the start pages. This gives us a sense of how often each task is actually used. It continues to help us tell where improving tasks could have the greatest impact.

### 3. Validating the top tasks with website visitors

Once tasks are identified, analyzed, and ranked, we validate them with website visitors. This will include asking people why they came to the site. They can choose from the tasks we identified or add their own reason for coming to Canada.ca. This way we can fill in any gaps, which will give us greater confidence that the tasks we've identified are actually what people come to do.

Over the next year, we're planning to work with departments and agencies on these top task surveys and further mature our approach to top tasks.

## How top tasks will change service delivery

Top task performance is the basis for optimizing Canada.ca, but we won’t be stopping at just the website. We plan on using top tasks to inform overall service delivery. Right now, our top tasks reflect the online portion of the tasks. But, we're also working with service providers to make sure task improvements are connected with all the ways government serves the public.
