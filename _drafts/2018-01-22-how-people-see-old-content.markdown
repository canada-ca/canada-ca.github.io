We had some interesting results related to content age in a recent usability study. It showed us about how people perceive content based on its age. This might influence how we present the date updated on Canada.ca.

## How old content is

Currently, there are two main ways to how up-to-date content is on Canada.ca. One is in a standard place on each page:

[img - screenshot showing date modified on a typical Canada.ca page]

(One change we've just added to the Content and Information Architecture Specification is to display the date in a more human-readable format here: like "January 22, 2018")

Since it's in the same place on every Government of Canada web page, people can count on finding it if they're wondering about when the page was last updated. 

The second place the date appears is in the search engine results. Both on Google:

...and on the Canada.ca search:

[img - Canada.ca serp with date highlighted]

In design guidance for Canada.ca, we say that you should:
 
"Use the date modified component to provide a person with the date that the content was last updated."

* [Headers, footers and navigation for Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification/headers-footers-navigation.html#toc3)

Typically, that gets updated when there's a substantial change. Not just fixing a typo, but something that actually changes the content. But if there's no reason to update the content, that date won't change. It can start to look old, even if it's still very much up to date. 

## How content age influences people

People really notice the age of the content presented, especially if it's a subject that seems like it should be changing often. Something like vaccinations recommended for pregnant women seems to fall into that category!

Here's s video of a usability test participant disregarding the best page to solve his task due to its age (voice disguised):

<figure class="wb-mltmd">
	<video poster="TBD" title="Thinking information is out of date">
		<source type="video/mp4" src="../images/date-filter-loses-results-en.mp4" />
		<track src="#inline-captions" kind="captions" data-type="text/html" srclang="en" label="English" />
	</video>
	<figcaption>
		<p>Looking for a Job (<a href="cpts-lg-en.html">Transcript</a>)</p>
	</figcaption>
</figure>

We saw the same thing with other participants too. For something scientific, even if the information is perfectly valid, people still thought there should be something newer. 

## What we can do about it

We should be reviewing content regulary as part of a content management lifecycle. And when you review a page and confirm that it's still valid, update the date modified.
