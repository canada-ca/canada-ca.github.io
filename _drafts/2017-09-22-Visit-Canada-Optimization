Canada.ca does not only serve Canadian citizens. The most requested task for people outside of Canada on the site is to apply for a travel visa or an electronic travel authorization (eTA). If you have never heard of an eTA before, you are not alone. Many countries require people to have a government issued travel visa to visit, but Canada has two. Getting an electronic travel authorization is cheaper and faster than getting a visa, but still many people don’t understand the distinction. It’s not hard to see why, because the rules can be complex. 
We tried to solve this problem through an optimization project. Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) worked together for two months to improve the user experience for foreign nationals planning to visit Canada. 
The project team faced a dilemma early on; do we test with Canadians speaking English and French or do we test with foreign nationals using their own language. Intuitively it seems obvious to test with foreign nationals, since the task is for those people, but doing so is much more expensive and time consuming. Our solution was to use different types of testing for different purposes. The testing methods used in this project were:
1. Moderated testing with Canadians
2. Unmoderated testing with foreign nationals
3. “Guerilla” or “Café” testing with Canadians 
4. Survey testing with Canadians and foreign nationals

<img src="/images/VisitFunnels.png" alt="This image shows that before the optimization efforts, only 35% of people went from the Visit Canada topic page to one of the following pages: Apply for a Visa, Apply for an eTA, Find out if you need a visa or an eTA. On the current live site that number increased to 62%. Additionally, there is now 10% traffic to the Visit Canada topic page directly from the top menu of the site.">
