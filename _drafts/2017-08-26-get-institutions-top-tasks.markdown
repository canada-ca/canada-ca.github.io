It can be hard to keep track of all of the digital content an institution produces. Managing by tasks is a way to focus attention on what's most important - how people use that content. This article describes how Government of Canada institutions can gather their top tasks and use them to manage their content. 

### Top task management
 
Top task management isn't new to the Government of Canada. Some institutions had conducted exercises to determine their top tasks even before Canada.ca was started in 2013, and among them, some departments even use mature top task collection techniques such as user surveys.

Bringing these departments and agencies less experienced with top task management together, to discuss how they could build a site together for Canadians and was the first step 

to the same table, to discover how those tasks fit together was one of the objectives of setting up Theme Leads for Canada.ca.

there are a lot of departments and agencies in the government, many of which don't even 

, some even going beyond analytics and using surveys to get a good picture of their user needs. 




For others, we asked them to consider a variety of sources:

Some institutions in the Government of Canada have been using top tasks models over the past few years to 



* Departmental plans
* Mandate letters (from the Prime Minister to cabinet ministers)
* web analytics
* feedback or call centre reports
* stakeholder input
* past research or surveys

By reviewing these sources and carefully analyzing the results, institutions could identify all of the tasks they support for the public. 


## What we mean by a task
 
A task is basically what someone wants to do. For example, some typical tasks might be: 

* renew my passport
* find out when vaccinations are needed
* get insurance for my crops

These are the kinds of tasks we want to identify and help support. Something you don't need to track is something like:

* View a video
* Download a publication
* View frequently asked questions

These aren't things that people actually want to do, even though they might be something that they do to support a task. 

"Tasks" could just as easily be called "goals" - the term isn't important. The important thing is that it be a realistic depiction of what people are actually trying to do, and written at a level that's useful in managing content. 

The nice thing about tasks is that it forces you to think in terms of what the visitor wants to get done. It shifts the focus from the organization (who might want to publish something), to the visitor (who needs to learn something, access a service, or apply for something). 

That doesn't guarantee success of course. But it puts you in the right position to manage content in a way that focuses on the people who use it.

## What level task should you record

You want to record the task at the level where it's the most useful to you in managing content. That can vary depending on what you're doing. For example, at a broad policy design level, knowing the underlying goals people have would be useful. "Save money for college", "get a better job". But on the level of managing content on a website, those might be too high. Similarly, "Download form X343-B" is too low a level to be useful. Ideally you'd identify tasks at the level the visitor has in mind when they come to the site. 


## Where organizations can get their tasks

The first step is to go through all of the sources available to you to pick out the tasks you currently do, or should, support. Some sources to look through include:

### Mandate letters

The Prime Minister sent every cabinet minister a letter detailing what they were expected to accomplish. These mandate letters are a rich source for identifying tasks that the institution must support. 

For example, the [mandate letter for the Minister of Public Services and Procurement](http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-public-services-and-procurement-mandate-letter) includes:

> Undertake a review of Canada Post to make sure it provides the high-quality service that Canadians expect at a reasonable price.

This requirement will result in tasks related to informing people about the review, and depending on how it's carried out, possibly to participate in the review. An associated task might be:

"Comment on the Canada Post review"

http://pm.gc.ca/eng/mandate-letters

### Departmental plans

In the Government of Canada, we're lucky to have very clear guidance as to exactly what departments and agencies are supposed to do. These come in the form of departmental plans and mandates.   

Each task you identify should be directly attributable to one of the department's priorities in the departmental plan or mandate letter. If it isn't, it's probably not a task you should be supporting. 

(Example)

### Call-centre and support

These are the people who hear from people the most often. Every institution has some sort of contact address or phone number. The people who respond to those requests are a gold mine of information about the people your website supports. 

This can help you understand the priority of the tasks (assuming a high volume is higher priority). They can also help you identify gaps in the tasks you've thought you've collected.

### Your existing content and analytics

This is probably the easiest way to identify tasks, though you should keep in mind that it may not be entirely accurate. (Just because something is popular doesn't necessarily mean it's a top task, and vice versa). However, you can actually get a pretty good idea of what might currently be top tasks for an organization just by looking at what the top pages are, and determining what tasks those pages support. 

Even here you have to be careful of course. Just because a page is popular doesn't mean it's a top task. For example, at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, one of the top pages was the "Maladies de vignes", or "Vine diseases". It presented information about diseases affecting grapes. We found that most of the visitors were from France, and determined that it was people trying to identify and deal with diseases affecting their grapes. 

Now that page was effective. It was well written, included useful photos, and presented useful information to people. And it was popular, being one of the top pages on the site. However, you still couldn't call that a top task of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. In fact, while the page still exists, it's archived now because they determined that it wasn't content that the department of Agriculture needed to maintain. 

### Surveys

Some departments run annual or biannual exit surveys to get some information about the people who visit their sites. A useful question to ask on this kind of survey is "What did you come to the site to do?". The information this provides can be overwhelming - it'll be hard to process and categorize. But you may learn a great deal about what people are actually coming to your site to do. 

### Interviews and other research

Talking directly to the people your department serves will almost always yield useful insights. Even if you're among the target audience for your department, there will always be people who have a different perspective and different needs. The more exposure you have to people, the better your understanding of what your organization should be trying to accomplish. 

## What kinds of tasks should you not collect

Some types of tasks aren't distinct to your organization, and really are the same for every organization. This includes things like contacting someone, looking for a job at the organization, and applying for programs. These are key tasks of course, but they're not useful to record as top tasks for your organization since they're not distinct. We tend to address these common tasks in common ways - contact through the institutional profile and "Contact" link in the footer, etc. 

You can still collect these of course, and use them within your organization. But you don't need to report such tasks to TBS, and you may not have to manage them either since they're likely to be addressed in a standard way. 

## Writing the task at the right level

One of the hard things about writing tasks is putting them at a level that's useful. And this is really the deciding factor in what level you should situate your tasks at. Is it useful? 

As an example, suppose you're listing the tasks for your organization as a whole. Depending on the breadth of the mandate of the organization, you might need to go a little bit broader in your task descriptions. For example, an organization like the Parole Board of Canada has very discrete offerings to the public:

"Apply for a record suspension"

Of course there are associated tasks around that, including learning what record suspensions are, finding out who's eligible, and the like. 

## Organizations with no or very few tasks 

You might even have an institution with no tasks that can be accessed by the public. Shared Services Canada may fall into that category. For them, the only public tasks are likely to be related to finding out what the department does. That's OK! Having a lot of public tasks doesn't say anything about how important an organization is across the government. And resisting the urge to describe what every organization does can help reduce the number of little-used pages there are on the web.
