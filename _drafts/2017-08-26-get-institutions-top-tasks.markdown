It can be hard to keep track of all of the digital content an institution produces. Managing by tasks is a way to focus attention on what's most important - how people use that content. This article describes, particularly for government of canada institutions, the methods to gather top tasks in a way that's comparable with the canada.ca top 100 tasks.

## What we mean by a task
 
A task is basically what someone wants to do. For example, some typical tasks might be: 

* renew my passport
* find out when vaccinations are needed
* get insurance for my crops

These are the kinds of tasks we want to identify and help support. Something you don't need to track is something like:

* View a video
* Download a publication
* View frequently asked questions

These aren't things that people actually think about doing, even though they might be something that they do to support a task. 

"Tasks" could just as easily be called "goals" - the term isn't important. The important thing is that it be a realistic depiction of what people are actually trying to do, and written at a level that's useful in managing content. 

The nice thing about tasks is that it forces you to think in terms of what the visitor wants to get done. 

This doesn't mean that we're creating new policies or services, but we're shifting the focus from how the organization thinks about their service (what we're doing and how we're doing it) to how the visitor consumes it (ensuring they can actually apply, understand the guidance to comply or make safe or healthy decisions, which in turn contribute to policy outcomes and change for Canadians).

That doesn't guarantee success of course. But it puts you in the right position to manage content in a way that focuses on the people who use it.

## How to identify tasks

There are various sources that departments and agencies can use to identify top tasks:

       <p>Departmental plans In the Government of Canada, we're lucky to have very clear guidance as to exactly what departments and agencies are supposed to do. These come in the form of departmental plans and mandates.</p>  
<p>Each task you identify should be directly attributable to one of the department's priorities in the departmental plan or mandate letter. If it isn't, it's probably not a task you should be supporting.</p>

       <p>The Prime Minister sent every cabinet minister a letter detailing what they were expected to accomplish. These mandate letters are a rich source for identifying tasks that the institution must support.</p>
       <p>For example, the [mandate letter for the Minister of Public Services and Procurement](http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-public-services-and-procurement-mandate-letter) includes:</p>
       <p>Undertake a review of Canada Post to make sure it provides the high-quality service that Canadians expect at a reasonable price.</p>
       <p>This requirement will result in tasks related to informing people about the review, and depending on how it's carried out, possibly to participate in the review. An associated task might be:</p>
       <p>"Comment on the Canada Post review"</p>
       <p>http://pm.gc.ca/eng/mandate-letters</p>

       <p>These are the people who hear from people the most often. Every institution has some sort of contact address or phone number. The people who respond to those requests are a gold mine of information about the people your website supports.</p>
       <p>This can help you understand the priority of the tasks (assuming a high volume is higher priority). They can also help you identify gaps in the tasks you've thought you've collected.</p>

     <details class="mrgn-bttm-sm"> 
       <summary class="wb-toggle" data-toggle="{&quot;print&quot;:&quot;on&quot;}"><strong>Description</strong></summary> 
       <p>This is probably the easiest way to identify tasks, though you should keep in mind that it may not be entirely accurate. (Just because something is popular doesn't necessarily mean it's a top task, and vice versa). However, you can actually get a pretty good idea of what might currently be top tasks for an organization just by looking at what the top pages are, and determining what tasks those pages support. </p>
       <p>Even here you have to be careful of course. Just because a page is popular doesn't mean it's a top task. For example, at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, one of the top pages was the "Maladies de vignes", or "Vine diseases". It presented information about diseases affecting grapes. We found that most of the visitors were from France, and determined that it was people trying to identify and deal with diseases affecting their grapes. </p>
       <p>Now that page was effective. It was well written, included useful photos, and presented useful information to people. And it was popular, being one of the top pages on the site. However, you still couldn't call that a top task of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. In fact, while the page still exists, it's archived now because they determined that it wasn't content that the department of Agriculture needed to maintain.</p>

       <p>Some departments run annual or biannual exit surveys to get some information about the people who visit their sites. A useful question to ask on this kind of survey is "What did you come to the site to do?". The information this provides can be overwhelming - it'll be hard to process and categorize. But you may learn a great deal about what people are actually coming to your site to do.</p>

## What level task should you record

As task is, basically, what someone wants to do on the website.

As you start asking what Canadians are doing, however, you'll notice that the task could be "find what I need to travel abroad", including passports, registering with the government abroad, checking health advisories and finding out what they can bring on a plane. It could as likely be "Apply for a passport". Or even "find out about the passport application fees", "download form PPTC 153" or "renew a passport".

It's clear that there depending on how broadly you're defining a task, it could include various subtasks and subtasks to those subtasks. All of these levels can be useful depending on what you're doing.

At a broad policy design level or when determining high level labels in your information architecture, knowing the high level goals people have would be useful. But on the level of ranking tasks, a lower level will better represent the specific content you have published.

On the other hand, "Download form PPTC 153" is so specific that it might not even be an essential task, visitors deciding to fill out an online form or get a different form to renew their passport and succeeding all the same.

Ideally you phrase tasks as are most likely the visitor would describe them when reflecting afterwards about what he completed something. In this case, "I applied for a passport today" is a more likely level of task than "I found out what I needed to travel abroad", which would have been branched into secondary tasks as he learned more about what he need to do or "I downloaded form PPTC 153", which is just one step in what he needed to do to complete his task.

## What kinds of tasks should you not collect

Some types of tasks aren't distinct to your organization, and really are the same for every organization. This includes things like contacting someone, looking for a job at the organization, and applying for programs. These are key tasks of course, but they're not useful to record as top tasks for your organization since they're not distinct. We tend to address these common tasks in common ways - contact through the institutional profile and "Contact" link in the footer, etc. 

You can still collect these of course, and use them within your organization. But you don't need to report such tasks to TBS, and you may not have to manage them either since they're likely to be addressed in a standard way. 

## Writing the task at the right level

One of the hard things about writing tasks is putting them at a level that's useful. And this is really the deciding factor in what level you should situate your tasks at. Is it useful? 

As an example, suppose you're listing the tasks for your organization as a whole. Depending on the breadth of the mandate of the organization, you might need to go a little bit broader in your task descriptions. For example, an organization like the Parole Board of Canada has very discrete offerings to the public:

"Apply for a record suspension"

Of course there are associated tasks around that, including learning what record suspensions are, finding out who's eligible, and the like. 

## Organizations with no or very few tasks 

You might even have an institution with no tasks that can be accessed by the public. Shared Services Canada may fall into that category. For them, the only public tasks are likely to be related to finding out what the department does. That's OK! Having a lot of public tasks doesn't say anything about how important an organization is across the government. And resisting the urge to describe what every organization does can help reduce the number of little-used pages there are on the web.

## What your list might look like

## Using the list to manage content











Top task surveys have been a fantastic method for some organizations and businesses to rank their tasks. Not only can surveys capture the importance of some tasks that aren't easily completable on the website, but they can identify tasks that users expect to 



Already, a lot of the research behind identifying tasks is not based on visits, but rather search phrase analytics and call centre data.

Neither of these can provide comparable data for how important a task are, since often calls and searches are driven by issues with finding and completing a task. But they are a valuable 


1 Where people "start" the task
 
In previous versions of the list, we found that some tasks seemed to have an unusually high number of visits. This might be because there were a lot of pages associated with a task, or because the task involved a search interface that reported separately for every search result. To avoid complications from these issues, we instead focused on the page where most people tend to start the task. 

2  A sense of the traffic
 
Once we have a start page, we wanted to get a sense of how much traffic the page gets. This isn't necessarily a strong indicator of how important a task is. It's possible that something is a top task, but people have a hard time finding it. 

3 Search terms people use to get to the task
 
Search logs provide a view into what people are thinking when they visit a website. They also show how often people look for particular things. If you can tell what terms people used to get to the top tasks, then you can refine the related content to make that path even easier for people. 

See [Search-Log Analysis: The Most Overlooked Opportunity in Web UX Research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-log-analysis/) for tips on why and how to analyze search log data.

4 Top requests to call centres

Call centres get to talk directly to the people using government services. If we know what issues the call centre hears about, we get a good sense of what’s important to people.  

Again, just because an issue comes to a call centre a lot doesn’t mean it’s a top task. For example, one of the most common questions Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada gets is whether dogs are allowed on the [Central Experimental Farm](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-us/offices-and-locations/central-experimental-farm/?id=1170701489551). Important information for some, but not a top task for the department. 
 
5 Proportion of mobile visits
 
We have a good view of how many people are visiting Canada.ca with mobile devices, but not how that proportion varies from task to task. This data provides a useful view into where some tasks remain solidly on the desktop, and which tend to be accessed more through mobile devices.





There are still some issues with using analytics to rank tasks, not least of which is that visiting a certain webpage doesn't necessarily mean it's more important.

The number 1 ranked task for Canada.ca is finding out the local weather conditions. Looking for the local weather conditions is undoubtedly a task that is important and impactful to most. 

But to many canadians, the weather forecast is something they can get as easily from the weather network or the radio as it is on the government website. In contrast, getting a business number or applying for parental leave benefits might be equally or more important a user task, not to mention have a greater impact on the economy or people's health.

Some businesses use the top task survey model to fill in the gaps in analytics data.
