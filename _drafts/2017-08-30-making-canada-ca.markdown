<!--Objectives: demonstrate how we evolved the theme and topic layer that users see reflected in the main nav for Canada.ca -->

In 2012, the Government of Canada began working towards a more centralized web presence. The vision for Canada.ca was to make it easier for Canadians to find what they were looking for, whichever department or agency might provide it. Here's the research and testing we did to tackle the challenge of designing the site's structure that you see reflected in its main navigation.

## Themes: bridges across the thousand islands

While some people know which department provides a service, many don’t know or care. As each department and agency maintains a website of their own, there wasn't a single online window where a Canadian could find all government services. 

<!-- By focusing on the words that people think about when they complete a task, we can make it easiler for people to find and complete what they came to do. -->
 
The first step was to understand the most in-demand tasks that citizens undertook with the federal government. So in 2013, we worked with departments and agencies to collect and analyze as much web traffic data as we could to create an inventory of top 100 Government of Canada tasks.

To learn more about the top 100 tasks, see [Top task management on Canada.ca]().

Then, we card sorted the top tasks to come up with a preliminary list of about 20 categories to organize Canada.ca content. In this research step, we proposed an initial set of subject-based themes, such as taxes and immigration, as well as more administrative categories like media or contact information.    

<!-- ** How did we group them originally?** Not sure actually where the themes came from - will check -->

After negotiation with internal stakeholders, we had 15 theme labels that would form the main navigation for canada.ca and the mortar to build bridges between departmental websites and tasks.

## Testing the building blocks

Coming up with the themes was only the first step, both for the taxonomy and the navigation on Canada.ca.

We next did a tree test with 848 citizens to validate the theme and topic structure. This showed us the value in a subject-based approach and allowed us to simplify the structure.

The first task after themes were decided was to create the rest of the navigation tree. Each topic would be a keyword for citizens to find the next step towards their task but would also have to reflect the various perspectives and services government had on that topic. 

Designs were made to help guide Canadians through their journey, while also giving them the chance to offramp to most requested tasks and explore more about government policy or opportunities to provide feedback.

*Insert graphic on sections of the topic page - perhaps similar to the IP one Manu made? Maybe use a mobile view?*

Then, we invited Canadians to try finding the top tasks in these new designs. 

We built simple prototypes of two different options for themes and did usability testing with 30 citizens. From this, we were able to generate a new design which was used for the initial launch of Canada.ca in December 2013, and is still in use today.

## Ongoing testing

Our research and testing on themes and navigation have only increased since Canada.ca was first launch and we will continue to refine the navigation model.

*Testing results from various rounds, iterative decisions made?*

<!-- moved all the search stuff out, should be a separate article on search -->

## Optimizing tasks

After 4 years, many of the bridges of topics and search are now in place and we're now shifting our focus to end-to-end task improvements.

To learn more about iterative improvements we're making to the top canada.ca tasks, please see [optimization projects umbrella article???]().
