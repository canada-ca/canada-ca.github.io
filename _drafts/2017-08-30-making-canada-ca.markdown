<!--Objectives: demonstrate how the themes reflect top tasks, how they work with search, how we've applied rigorous user testing to topic and doormat designs -->

In 2012, the Government of Canada began working towards a more centralized web presence. The vision for Canada.ca was to make it easier for Canadians to find what they were looking for, whichever department or agency might provide it.

## Themes: bridges across the thousand islands

While some people know which department provides a service, most don’t know or care. As not only each department and agency maintains a website of their own, there was no online window where a Canadian could find all government services. 

By focusing on the words that people think about when they complete a task, we can make it easiler for people to find and complete what they came to do.
 
The first step was to understand the top tasks that citizens completed with departments and agencies. 

To learn more about the top 100 tasks, see [Top task management on Canada.ca]().

Then, we card sorted the most in demand tasks to come up with a preliminary list of themes to organize Canada.ca content. **Did we actually do a cardsort? How did we group them originally?**

After negotiation with departmental and political stakeholders, we had 15 theme labels that would form the persistent navigation for canada.ca and the mortar to build bridges between departmental websites and tasks.

## Testing the building blocks

Coming up with the themes was only the first step, both for the taxonomy and the navigation on Canada.ca.

*It's somewhat awkward that we can't talk about the search design, considering they still have a filter box on the results page by document type......... If we did do something about it, we could put this section beneath the next one on search and nav, which would flow better.*

The first task after themes were decided was to create the rest of the navigation tree. Each topic would be a keyword for citizens to find the next step towards their task but would also have to reflect the various perspectives and services government had on that topic.

Designs were made to help guide Canadians through their journey, while also giving them the chance to offramp to most requested tasks and explore more about government policy or opportunities to provide feedback.

*Insert graphic on sections of the topic page - perhaps similar to the IP one Manu made? Maybe use a mobile view?*

Then, we invited Canadians to try finding the top tasks in these new designs. 

*Testing results from various rounds, iterative decisions made?*




## Search and navigation

Theme navigation is not the only bridge across departments.

In his book “Don’t Make Me Think”, Steve Krug mentioned the similarities between a store and a website.

Just as customers in a store might follow aisle signs or ask for help, website visitors use both navigation and search to find their tasks:

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Navigation and search" src="/images/nav-and-search_700x215.png"> *jennifer said she could take photos we can use, if we need (old photos in the deck were just internal from google and I can't find anything for reuse - there might be in stock photography?)*

Asking for help in a store is often a method of last resort. Likewise, Canadians will often go to search when they can't find something on the page. In government, this often happens when tasks from one department can't be found on another department's website despite the closely related nature of the tasks.

In 2013 *not actually sure of the timelines here*, a Government of Canada wide search was implemented. Departments and agencies still have the option of contextualising results to their web content, but Canadians have the option to see results from across government.

Of course, the real challenge for search is only beginning. We're now working with themes and departments to make sure that top search phrases give relevant results, written clearly so they can be differentiated from similar results. We're also trying to improve the search results to be contextual to where they searched from and developing new pages for search terms common to many tasks and institutions. 

To learn more about how we have been helping Canadians find the right contact when they search for contact information, see [Developing the contact us approach on Canada.ca]().

## Optimizing tasks

After 4 years, many of the bridges of topics and search are now in place and we're now shifting our focus to end-to-end task improvements.
