# What is this blog for?

- Communicating our value proposition - making Canada.ca better, improving digital services for citizens
- Blog as expression of what are we about: 
	- evidence based design/decision-making
	- relentlessly continuously improving - adopting lean and agile approaches, learning as we go
	- ruthlessly prioritizing citizen needs - top tasks driving & feeding overall Canada.ca design
	- content first (rather than fancy features or functionalites)
	- coherent UX for Canadians
- Why bother doing this? The rationale is that .... (see comms and engagement strat)

# Objectives
 
- Align with overall strategy of working in the open & showing our accountability
- Demonstrate leadership in terms of #GCdigital, product design, usability, research and testing 
- Catalyze workforce transformation by example
- It’s a lifestyle, baby (also recruiting)

# Who are we doing this for?

- Primary audience: people making web things in GC - from noobs to unicorns, from design to content to code
- Secondary audiences: 
	- people who manage GC services/programs and need to consider digital more deeply
	- people who make web things in other govts, in the private sector etc.

# Considerations / ground rules 

- Bilingual
- Accessible
- Simple / Clear - plain language, grade 10 level - use Fleisch-Kincaid tools
- Eating our own dog food - abide by style guide and spec
- Two way? (maybe after we’re up and rolling, until then handle this angle off-blog via social media)

# Tactics

## Content strat

- write about UX design, research & testing (& analysis), optimization / content improvement (not migration or platforms or production)
- articles should:
	- Demonstrate what we’ve done / show the evidence
	- Show how we work / why we work in a collaborative manner
	- Provide actionable insights 
- MVP approach - start small & simple, then build up from there
- Share everything we write via other social networks - #GCdigital

## Structure
- default structure - blog (articles in reverse chrono) 
- tags & categories
	- categories for series of articles:
	1. usability issues - documenting issues and solutions
	2. optimization projects - things we saw, lessons learned
	- tags for article topics/subjects

## Writing techniques
- Short articles – as succinct as possible, think in terms of “one pagers”
- team effort: each post only go live when at least two people have taken a crack at it
- Focus on facts: articles that tell stories about what we did, what we learned - not pure theory or unsubstantiated opinion 
- Cite evidence & experience always, esp. our own data, lessons learned 
- Advice not rules - write in terms of examples of how we did X to solve problem/issue/challenge Y, rather than "you must do..." 
- Use pair writing, timeboxing and trading off to keep moving


# Writing articles - Do’s and don’ts

## Overall tone
- DO use a conversational tone
- DO write directly to the reader (“you” “your”)
- DO respect the Canada.ca Content Style Guide

## Talking about ourselves
- DO refer to our team informally – “the Canada.ca product team at TBS” or something
- DO write in terms of the team - "we did...", "the team observed..."
- DO mention line depts. we work with
- DON’T single out people by name (until we sort out if that’s kosher)

## Images and multimedia
- DO use images and videos 
- DO get permission first
- DO give credit - if we are not the source, mention source 
- DO follow spec and style guide 
- DON’T break privacy rules - review before posting

## Linking
- DO link to external sources: other govts who are doing similar work, experts in the field, etc.
- DON'T link to internal-to-GC stuff, it's rude to exclude people who can't get at gcpedia etc.
- DON’T link in-line; make links stand alone between paragraphs or gather links in an “explore further” block at the end of the article

## Citing data and evidence
- DO mention sources - keep it simple
- DO include date ranges for data
- DO include data tables for charts and graphs (or link to them?)

## Feedback/questions
- DO provide a contact email at the end of articles (ux.eu@tbs-sct.gc.ca)
- DON'T provide official guidance on the blog or on social media

## Sharing blog posts
- DO share articles via your own social media accounts if you wish 
- DON'T feel forced to promote the blog via social media

## Measuring success
- "being open" KPI TBD
- "leading by example" KPI TBD
- "catalyzing transformation" KPI TBD

# Parking lot / next steps
- beyond the team - guest posts from other institutions
