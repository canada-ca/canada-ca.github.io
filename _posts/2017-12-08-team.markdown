The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) is part of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Strategic Communications and Ministerial Affairs sector. At DTO, we are communications professionals with expertise in content and interaction design, user research and plain language writing.

We work with departments to:

* ensure that the Canada.ca brand is recognized and trusted by Canadians

* make information and services that are in demand and published on digital channels easier to find and understand based on insight from user research

* help communications teams develop their skills and processes as they make a sustainable shift to digital in their organization
