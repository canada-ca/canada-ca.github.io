Buttons are a design element that let you add interaction to a page. 

Consider using buttons when:

* helping a person into or through a transaction such as “Sign in”
* invoking functionality, for example “Share this page”
* providing a persistent set of UI controls across a series of pages, for example “previous”, “next”, or “back to table of contents”

Don’t use buttons when an ordinary text link will do the job just as well. Overuse reduces their visual impact.

##  super task button

Among the button options in the design system is the super task button. It’s a large-ish, attractive green button and it really gets your attention! This button can be powerful...but “with great power comes great responsibility.” 

So, how do you use this button properly?

Use this button to launch the main task or next step - when that task or step is what the majority of the visitors to the page are coming to do.
