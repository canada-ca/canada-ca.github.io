Starting a business is a top task for Canadians and it’s not an easy one. There are legal requirements to meet depending on the size and type of business, spread across the provinces and federal departments including of course, the Canada Revenue Agency since hopefully the business will make money. Together with Industry Canada and Canada Revenue Agency, the TBS User Experience Optimization Team set out to improve online access and service to Canadians starting a business. We started with user needs and worked through from end to end.  

## Topic pages fill the cracks between departments 

Canada.ca exists to provide better online service to Canadians for their top tasks and topic pages play a key role. Many people don't know or care which department offers a particular service. Topic pages bring together all of the service tasks onto one page, across federal departments. They act almost as a ‘home page’ for that set of services. If you are a mariner for example, the [Marine Transportation topic page](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/transport/marine.html) on Canada.ca shows tasks from 7 different departments, from navigating to licensing to pollution. 

Topic pages have a consistent look based on a template outlined in the Content and IA spec. Over time, some parts of the topic page template have been improved as user research, usually task-based usability testing with Canadians, has highlighted problems. But on the whole, there has only been the one template available, with some optional pieces. When the team started the optimization project, the start a business topic page looked like this:

## Starting with user needs
One of the first things we noticed in our user researchpeople considering starting a business were often at different phases in their familiarity in the process. Some entrepreneurs knew exactly what they wanted to do, for example, just get a business number and operate provincially or incorporate with the federal government. Others were daunted by all the decisions and wondered if they needed to hire some kind of advisor to dig through the rules and options.

Before we came up with the approach, to understand what entrepreneurs were going through, the project team started by asking 'What are the things that entrepreneurs have to know to make their decisions about registration?'. Each of the business steps have a lot of thinking behind them:

Should I incorporate?
- Will I benefit from corporate tax rates?
- What are the liability risks for my business sector?

Should I set up a sole-proprietorship, partnership or cooperative?
- Will I be sharing the profits with a business partner or a set of investors?

Do I need to get a unique business name?
- Will operating under my own name harm my chances at success?
- Will I be selling my products online or in different provinces?

What tax accounts do I need?
- Am I planning to hire? - Payroll
- Is my business going to make more than $30k this year? - GST/HST
- Are my products or services exempt from GST/HST? - GST/HST
- Do I need to import or export? - Import/export

What other things do I have to register for?
- Am I operating in a province where business insurance is required?
- What provinces am I operating in?
- What other permits or licences apply to my business activities?

What do I need to get my business started?
- Can I get start-up financing or grants?
- Do I need brand protection or intellectual property protection?

Even if an entrepreneur knows all their business inside-out, if they don't know the implications or thresholds, it can be a tricky maze with heavy repercussions. For a small business making less than $30k per year, accidentally registering for a GST/HST number means they'll be required to add a 10% tax charge on all their sales, a requirement that can be burdensome on small business. Similarly, an entrepreneur that didn't incorporate because they thought it was too complicated and didn't understand the value, could find themselves in a higher tax bracket, or personally bearing the financial liability for a court case against the company.

## Conveying the sequence and understanding it ourselves
The steps required to start a business weren't clearly laid out on the topic page - people simply didn't know where to find them, and with so many links on the Starting a business page, they went off in all directions. Yet the main role of government in starting a business is to support those legal steps - steps like registering the business, choosing a name that didn"t already exist, getting a business number and opening GST and payroll accounts. 

These decisions were complicated by the different government priorities. Industry Canada was interested in helping people who wanted to incorporate federally, CRA with GST and corporate tax accounts, provinces with their own incorporation or permits. How could we bring it all into one process - particularly when the sequence wasn't clear even to us. 

The sequential topic page focused on ensuring entrepreneurs could:
1. Deal with one decision at a time, feeling secure that they weren't forgetting something
2. Understand which steps they could ignore and which were relevant to them, if they had already started the process somewhere else
3. Skip all the process pages and jump to the specific applications and registrations they needed

To do this, we made a single column of links, each of them numbered. 

Identifying the steps, sometimes involved pruning the options. Steps have to be stand-alone and simple enough to differentiate from other steps. To that end, instead of having guides, business plans and before starting a business, step 1 became a single link to business planning. 

In contrast, parts of the process had to be added to the page. Choosing a business name is a step all businesses have to go through, whether incorporating federally or provincially or just getting a business number. In the past, however, the website just included it in the bucket of links under business registration.
