Starting a business is a top task for Canadians and it’s not an easy one. There are many legal requirements to meet depending on the size and type of business, spread across the provinces and federal departments and agencies. We set out to simplify the Starting a Business task on Canada.ca and discovered that many of those steps have to be done in a particular order. Canadians in our research study not only couldnt figure out the order from the Canada.ca site at the time, but many couldnt even find any of the legal requirements at all.  To address this need, an Optimization   Together with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) and Canada Revenue Agency, the TBS User Experience Optimization Team created a simplified sequential pattern for topic pages that can be used for any high-level complex step by step sequence.  
## Topic pages fill the cracks between departments 

Canada.ca exists to provide better online service to Canadians for their top tasks and topic pages play a key role. Many people don't know or care which department offers a particular service. Topic pages bring together all of the service tasks onto one page, across federal departments. They act almost as a ‘home page’ for that set of services. 

Topic pages have a consistent layout based on a template described in the [Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specifications](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html). Over time, some parts of the topic page template have been improved as user research, usually task-based usability testing with Canadians, has highlighted problems. But on the whole, there has only been the one template available, with some optional pieces. When the team started the optimization project, the Start a business topic page looked like this:

## Sharing the headaches of start-up entrepreneurs in Canada
> Only 67% of the participants in our baseline test could identify essential legal steps to start a business. 

Many of the participants were business students. Some even confided in us that when they started their own business, they would probably have to hire an accountant or lawyer.

Unfortunately, starting a business is pretty complex. To register, an entrepreneur not only has to know which questions to ask, but they have to understand the threshholds, risks and limitations inherent in the options available to them. These processes are further complicated by the different priorities of government agencies. ISED was interested in helping people who wanted to incorporate federally, CRA with GST and corporate tax accounts, provinces with their own incorporation or permits. How could we bring it all into one process - particularly when the sequence wasn't clear even to us?

To develop our own understanding of what entrepreneurs would need, the project team mapped out the different decisions they had to make when starting their business.

## From pain points to user needs
It was clear that just dropping the tasks with the highest traffic at the top of the page wasn't going to cut it. Canadians simply didn't know where to look for the registration that was right for them, and with so many links on the Starting a business page, they went off in all directions. 

When an entrepreneur came to the topic page, we needed to make sure they could:
1. Deal with one decision at a time, feeling secure that they weren't forgetting or missing something
2. Understand which steps they might have done already and which were relevant to them, since many don't do all the steps with one government or agency
3. For those entrepreneurs who had one task, we wanted to make sure they weren't forced to read everything and could get to the specific application they needed

Identifying the steps, sometimes involved pruning the options. Steps have to be stand-alone and simple enough to differentiate from other steps. To that end, instead of having guides, business plans and before starting a business, step 1 became a single link to business planning. 

In contrast, choosing a business name is a crucial step to registering many businesses. This wasn't even present on the start a business topic in the past, found only when Canadians went to registration pages. 

## Conveying sequence in simplicity
Once we had struck a balance with a set of steps that would be simple enough to follow and broad enough to cover the key things new businesses legally are required to do, we were ready to tackel the design.

The steps required to start a business had to be clearly laid out page and still look like a Canada.ca topic page. We iterated the design, having people walk through it and discussing it with our teams and experts.

First, we added numbers and changed the heading to say 'steps'. When we noticed participants were still getting distracted, we removed the 'most requested' and 'what we are doing' links from the page. We found that a single column list was faster to scan and even managed to put the 'most requested' links back on the page for those entrepreneurs who wanted to skip through the supporting content.

## Reviewing how we did
>With the new simplified steps page, 100% of participants in a series of two additional studies could identify essential legal steps to start a business
>Business student participant: “I’d be going through all of these steps”

We were excited when we saw how comfortable the first few participants were with the page. They didn't have to spend time reading links and descriptions, instead scanning the page to see which numbered link was where they were in the process.

They also didn't feel the need to start from step 1, jumping right to the task for them. The steps gave them confidence that they weren't missing something crucial and could come back somewhere after completing each step.

After it was launched on the live site, we noticed:
- a drop in searches for all the main steps including 'naming a business', 'registering a business' and 'incorporation'
- more Canadians using BizPal, the Industry Canada wizard to find permits and licences
- more Canadians using both the incorporation and sole-priorietorship or partnership routes
- a sharp increase in people on the start a business page finding the grants and financing page
